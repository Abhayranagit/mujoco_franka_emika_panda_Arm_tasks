# mujoco_franka_emika_panda_Arm_tasks

 these are the project files in which i collect the task's demonstration performed by the franka emika panda arm in the mujoco simualtion . for the IK i have  used a library named as [pyroki](https://github.com/chungmin99/pyroki) which i gave a reference and you can also check there repo in the github . the library helps me to perform the task through franka emika panda arm in the given trajectories using the best possible joint angles . 
 
 
 Python version : 3.10.19
